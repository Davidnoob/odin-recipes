        <li><strong>Rice. And. Beans.</strong></li>

    <h2 class="cr">Follow these steps...</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Chop an onion and a bell pepper. Pick a colorful one. Fry them in some oil and add the beans, ideally with some of their own broth</li>
        <li>Cook the beans and add the rice. If you thought of adding the raw rice, just leave it here.</li>
        <li>Weirdly enough, a key ingredient is adding some Worcestershire sauce. Yeah, very central american.</li>
        <li>Mix it altogether and finally add some chopped coriander on top</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class="cr">Add one or two sunny side up eggs, bacon if you like, and get it on your belly!</h1>

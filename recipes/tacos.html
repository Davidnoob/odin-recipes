    <h2>Some Taco basics:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Tacos are quite straight forward. Just put some meat and toppings on a tortilla. That's it. The beauty and the possibilities that come out of simplicity.</li>
        <li>No need to be a chef to know that good ingredients make the difference. Forget about store-bought tortillas. Just, don't.<br>
            And if you have ever tried making a tortilla, you know it is simple to learn, difficult to master.</li>
        <li>Best case scenario: your mexican or central american mother or grandmother made some tortillas to you. If you don't have such grandma, then master the art of making tortillas.<br>
             Pro tip: if it starts inflating and becomes a big bubble when you flip it in the pan, you're doing it right. Good luck.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Got good tortillas, what's next?</h2>

    <p>Here are some basics you're going to need or want:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You know the first step. Tortillas. The fresher the better.</li>
        <li>Add meat to a tortilla. You can make veggie tacos if you wish, but they generally have meat.<br> 
            Pulled pork, carne asada, beef, chorizo, chicken, even fish... Your choice</li>
        <li>Chop some onions and coriander and sprinkle them over the meat in the tortilla. Some people like adding small pineapple chunks too.</li>
        <li>Pico de gallo. Which is fine chopped tomato, onion, coriander, salt and pepper, all mixed.</li>
        <li>Last but not least: sauce. You know mexicans need that spicy kick, but you can also just add green or red sauce.</li>
    </ol>
